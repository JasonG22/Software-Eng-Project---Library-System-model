# Software-Eng-Project---Library-System-model
This project extends a UML-based Library System in USE with state machines and OCL constraints to model borrowing, reservations, and fines. It distinguishes members and employees with role-specific logic and was tested through SOIL scripts, ensuring system reliability and consistent rule enforcement.
